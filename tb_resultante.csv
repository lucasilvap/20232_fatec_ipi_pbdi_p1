2,"Cyprus",16.272727272727273,"Fleshy peach, spice and citrus lead on this fresh, fun white from Cyprus, which displays good balance of refreshing summer fruit and minerals with an underpinning of honeyed softness. Versatile and easygoing, this will pair well with grilled fish and poultry."
3,"Turkey",24.633333333333333,"Said to be the first traditional method sparkling wine produced in Turkey, this is made from Kalecik Karasi, an indigenous red grape. It delivers a bouquet of Granny Smith apple, ripe peach and white flowers. These are followed by a strong sense of effervescence and flavors of nectarine, lemon, green apple and rose petal, with the faintest sense of sweetness. It is zesty and alive, culminating in a lingering peach-pie finish."
4,"Switzerland",85.28571428571429,"Vanilla and lemon curd aromas bring nuance and depth to the the complex bouquet of this wine. Full bodied with a silky texture, tones of green apple and mango show bright on the palate, leading to a splash of minerality on the finish."
5,"New Zealand",26.93178519593614,"This blend of 50% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc is ambitiously priced, but the quality is in the bottle. Next time you need a ringer for a right-bank Bordeaux tasting, here's a perfect candidate. Dried spices and a smooth, rich texture are the only hallmarks left from two years of barrel aging—the mocha and black cherry fruit is rich and luscious, developing tobacco nuances on the moderately tannic finish. Drink now and over the next 10 years."
6,"Italy",39.663769658271256,"Thanks to a special clone of Sauvignon, Giorgio Colutta has successfully paired this international variety to his unique territory, creating a distinctively Italian wine. Fresh aromas include citrus zest, wild sage, chopped herbs and kiwi yet the sharp edges you might find in French or New Zealand versions are absent. The wine boasts good acidity and a bright, zesty finish that cleans the palate and would pair perfectly with vegetable based exotic appetizers. Fire roasted eggplant with cumin, potato samosa or red lentil patties would stand up to the wine's gentle aromatic intensity."
7,"Uruguay",26.40366972477064,"Ignore the crazy price on this aged Tannat and enjoy the overall high quality of this Uruguayan bruiser. Sun-baked, minty, earthy aromas scream “warm-climate” wine, while the palate is chunky in feel, with some hardness. Flavors of rich, stewed berries, tons of oak, related spice and earth notes finish hefty but with minimal stuffing. Drink now."
8,"Hungary",40.648275862068964,"Though this dessert wine is already excellent, it's quite exciting to imagine how good it will be as its delicate flavors mingle over time. Made by the Szepsy family, whose roots go centuries (perhaps 1,000 years) deep in Hungary, the wine starts with a dense, slightly musky but floral nose. On the tongue, apricot, honey and spice mingle in a rich, opulent union, buoyed by a sparkling acidity that keeps the wine light and pretty."
9,"US",36.5734635584631,"Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date. Balancing cherry and plum fruit against the pretty barrel-infused tannins, it glides gracefully across the palate into a seamless finish.   Saggi is the Long Shadows collaboration with Tuscany's Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari. the blend in 2007 is 43% Sangiovese, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 21% Syrah. With each new vintage, the percentage of Sangiovese climbs, putting more Tuscany in this new world super-Tuscan wine. Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date. Balancing cherry and plum fruit against the pretty barrel-infused tannins, it glides gracefully across the palate into a seamless finish."
10,"China",18.0,"This deep ruby-colored wine features a bouquet of blackberry, tar and smoked meat. Chalky tannins provide a backdrop for a medley of fruit and savory flavors, including black cherry, cassis, flint and bacon. The soft finish is marked by a lingering smoke note."
11,"Luxembourg",23.333333333333332,"This non vintage white blend is composed of 50% Auxerrois, 40% Pinot Blanc, and 10% Pinot Gris. It has green apple and lemon pith aromas, lemon curd, apple juice and pastry flavors and a creamy finish."
12,"Czech Republic",24.25,"Made with 100% Cabernet Moravia (an indigenous crossing of Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt) this wine has an interesting bouquet of ripe red fruits marked by eucalyptus and a heavy vegetal note. Fruit flavors, especially dark plum, shine through on the palate, while greener herbal notes make their presence known on the invigorating finish."
13,"Armenia",14.5,"Deep salmon in color, this wine offers a bouquet of cantaloupe and nectarine. It is bright on entry, with full mouthfeel and flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and white peach that culminate in a bright citrus finish."
14,"Romania",15.241666666666667,"This collectible botrytis Riesling grown on the banks of the Danube in Romania is very concentrated, with heady flavors of honey, caramel and apricot and a nutty overall character. The finish is crisp and there's some acidity to keep the wine light on the palate. An unusual dessert wine and perhaps not for every wine lover, but definitely worthy of tasting and discussion. Imported by Vidalco International, LLC."
15,"Brazil",23.76595744680851,"Bell pepper and sharp red fruit aromas provide a shaky start, which is followed by cranberry, tart cherry and other pointed flavors. The feel is racy and tight, with gritty acids. Airing does improve it somewhat. Tasted twice; this is a review of the better bottle. Cabernet, Merlot, Cab Franc and Carmenère is the blend. From Brazil."
16,"Austria",30.76277241872097,"Hints of moss, yeast and freshly zested orange peel edged with pine honey initially suggest a dry wine. It is only on the palate that the richer and sweeter Auslese character comes to bear—again in the guise of dark, aromatic pine honey. The concentrated, deliciously bitter zestiness of the acidity, paired with the aromatically dark and equally bitter edge of the resinous honey provide a wonderful structure. While sweetness peaks up, it never gains the upper hand. This is a tight-rope walker of a wine with immense balance and poise. Glints of vanilla pod, candied peel and white pepper open up, vista after vista. If you are new to Grüner Auslese, this is the one to get you hooked."
17,"Australia",35.43766346992153,"Whether you ask me, God, or the lamp post, anyone who's ever had Australian Riesling will count this among the country's best versions of the variety. On the nose, it yields a little sweetness, plus some grapefruit and passion fruit; after a few minutes in the glass, the passion fruit aromas hold on and are joined by kiwi and other fresh tropical fruit. It's a very dry Riesling, with strong lime and a fresh herbal (perhaps cilantro?) flavors, which makes the mineral foundation seem that much drier and racier. Finishes medium-long with grapefruit and putty flavors. An excellent food wine…or an excellent  last meal in itself."
35,"Moldova",16.74576271186441,"Bright ruby in the glass, this wine is a blend of the Bastardo grape with indigenous varieties Saperavi and Rara Neagra. It offers a fruit-forward bouquet of cherry and blackberry. On the palate, flavors of freshly picked plum and black cherry with a touch of green pepper are sheathed in a lattice of supple tannins."
18,"Germany",42.25754716981132,"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness."
19,"Serbia",24.5,"This aged Riesling is medium gold colored, with pleasant aromas of lemon peel and petrol. It is round and generous on the palate, with flavors of lemon custard and green olive tapenade. The finish is long, with lingering flavors of lemon pith."
20,"Macedonia",15.583333333333334,"This Merlot-Cabernet-Vranec blend offers an appealing, easydrinking array of warming spice, dark berries and spice on the nose and palate. Full in the mouth with a fruity character backed by acid and spice, it will pair well with veal or pork."
21,"Canada",35.71259842519685,"West of the Okanagan valley, Similkameen Valley is being touted as the next great Canadian wine region. If these first releases from Vanessa are typical, they are right on track. This Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc blend is a supple and sensuous wine, with well-integrated flavors of fig, black cherry, brambly berry, roasted coffee and mocha. It's sturdy, layered and balanced, with a hint of smoke from aging 18 months in a mix of French and American oak."
22,"Portugal",26.21825641025641,"Pôpa was the family's nickname for grandpa. The winery, run by grandson Stéphane Ferreira, is the grandkids' tribute. This richly perfumed wine, by consultant Luis Pato, comes from a field blend of 21 grape varieties. Old vines with an average age of 82-years-old in a single parcel have given the wine huge concentration and rich swathes of tannins and black plum and damson fruit. The wine has power while also retaining plenty of elegance. It is an impressive wine, just approaching its peak and ready from 2018."
23,"Ukraine",9.214285714285714,"This nonvintage red dessert wine is made from Bastardo grapes. It is garnet in color with aromas of sweet cherry syrup and raspberry preserves. It has flavors of soda fountain cola spiked with cherry juice and cassis. It is delightfully sweet with a touch of acidity in the finish."
24,"Bulgaria",14.645390070921986,"The result of a joint project between Michel Rolland and Jair Agopian, this Bulgarian Bordeaux-style blend has primary aromas of ripe blackberry, dark cherry and black plum that give way to intriguing secondary notes of saddle leather, tobacco leaf and graphite. It exhibits nice weight on the midpalate with juicy flavors of cassis, black raspberry and cherry vanilla. The tannins are firm yet velvety and there is a surprising burst of bright fruit in the finish."
25,"Spain",28.215274608245853,"There are wines with mass appeal and others that are so idiosyncratic that only one in five people might like it. This falls into the latter category; it's barrel-fermented Viura with Sherry, dry wood, butterscotch and corn cake aromas. The mouth is creamy and resiny, with integrated acidity that keeps it afloat. Flavors of spiced pear, vanilla, cinnamon and toffee suggest amontillado Sherry and something elusive yet refined. Drink now with a rich seafood dish like lobster or baked turbot."
26,"Argentina",24.510117145899894,"From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise."
27,"Croatia",25.450704225352112,"There's so much nuance and complexity in this rustic yet fascinating Croatian wine, that it takes a while to break down its components. Initial scents of dried leaves and mulch blow off to reveal an array of delicate floral and fruit aromas, accented by rich chocolate and vanilla notes. Big in both alcohol and structure, its massively tannic, but smoothes out with aeration. Decant to drink now, but could easily evolve for 5–10 years."
28,"England",51.68115942028985,"Fragrant overtones of acacia honey play alongside lemony notes on the nose, adding a touch of restrained, exotic decadence. A hint of chalk contributes grounding dimension. All combine to make a fragrant nose. These themes play out again on the slender but expressive palate. Pure lemon freshness brightens the notions of honey and chalk, while tiny bubbles provide endless explosions of deep, sustained flavor. This wine seems still young and taut, but the energy suggests great future development. Lemon purity on the finish appeals with its clean and invigorating nature. Drink 2017–2027."
29,"Slovenia",24.8125,"Sivi Pinot is the Slovenian name for Pinot Gris and this will delight oenophiles looking for a new orange wine. It's pinkish brown in color due to two years of barrel aging and has aromas of peach cobbler and freshly baked piecrust. Smooth in the mouth, it discloses pronounced flavors of custard and crème brûlée. Think about pairing it with some of your strongest and ripest cheeses."
30,"Egypt",NULL,"Ripe pear, apple and tropical fruit in the nose leads into easy-drinking yellow fruit flavors on the palate. Creamy with a clean finish—a great everyday sip that will pair well with poultry, salads, cheeses."
31,"Greece",22.364425162689805,"This 100% Mavroudi, a regional red wine of Thrace, has an expressive, red-fruit nose with warm hints of vanilla and smoky spice. Grown in northeastern Greece on an ancient site overlooking the Aegean Sea, this is smooth and velvety with rich, spicy flavors and a lingering finish. Its texture and complexity lends it to pairings with more opulent dishes like rack of lamb and beef stew, but alternately, consider its Mediterranean roots and sip alongside a plate of spicy black olives or a Greek salad."
32,"India",13.333333333333334,"Deep garnet in the glass, this wine has a nose of blackberry and roasting meat. It offers a sophisticated mélange of flavors, in particular ripe red cherry, smoke, roasting meat, cranberry and light spice with a hint of brambles. It is very bright on entry, but tannins sneak up and then linger on the gums beyond a smooth finish that is punctuated by a touch of smoke."
33,"Georgia",19.321428571428573,"A winemaking history in a bottle, this Georgian wine made from Rkatsiteli grapes is an unusual peek into techniques tracing back 8,000 years. Deep gold in color due to an extended maceration on grape skins, this wine was aged in buried clay vessels, then oak, giving it a smoky, earthy profile with notes of butterscotch and roasted nut skins. There's not a lot of acidity, but it's refreshing with pretty orange peel notes and a grape tannin astringency on the finish."
34,"Morocco",19.5,"Dark red-violet in the glass, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Grenache has a nose of black cherry, green pepper and cocoa. It may be a little too cool for some tastes, but bright fruit and slightly luxurious tannins make up for the fennel and eucalyptus flavors that are joined on the palate by cherry, pomegranate and orange zest. The smooth finish goes completely cool for a second but winds up in a burst of bright fruit."
36,"Chile",20.786458333333332,"All signs point in one direction: the top of the heap. This is one great Chilean red blend! With Syrah, Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the mix, Gê sets a new benchmark for multigrape blends from Chile. This wine is loaded with berry, cassis and black plum flavors, but it's textured, balanced and alluring. There's a bit of creaminess on the finish to offset any tannic bite that's still holding on, but as a whole it's delicious, generous and ready to go. Best now through 2011."
37,"France",41.139120162016205,"There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too. Drink 2022–2040."
38,"Slovakia",16.0,"Delicious scents of honey, apples and petrol lead to a luscious, full-bodied palate full of smoke and honey with a gripping lime skin astringency on the finish. Rich in honey tones, yet quite dry, the palate is balanced with a bracing acidity."
39,"Israel",31.768916155419223,"The results of a partnership between Golan Heights Winery's Chief Winemaker Victor Schoenfeld and world-renowned winemaker and consultant Zelma Long, Rom (meaning “summit” in Hebrew) is a reference and tribute to the culmination of their relationship. The inaugural effort is a gorgeous wine composed of 37% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Merlot aged in French oak for 21 months. The result is a powerful, lush and concentrated wine loaded with black raspberry, blueberry, thin mint cookies and savory spice. Full weight with forward tannins and medium acidity, this is an Old World wine with a New World attitude."
40,"Mexico",26.785714285714285,"While this is fiery on the nose, you also get attractive, complex aromas of baked cherry, brandied plum, leather, coffee and chocolate. The flavor profile consists of red berry, chocolaty oak and spice, and things conclude with savory, roasted flavors cut by lasting acidity. This is a powerful, tannic yet sophisticated Nebbiolo that should improve with more time in the bottle."
41,"South Africa",24.668986852281517,"Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice. Firmly structured and robust in feel, try from 2022–2028, though it could mature well even beyond."
42,"Peru",18.0625,"Earthy plum and blackberry aromas are crisp and raw, with overt wood grain riding heavily on the bouquet. This is 60% Merlot and 40% Malbec; it feels grabby, while toasty, heavily oaked flavors of clove and bitter chocolate smother the wine's fruit before turning charred and roasted on the finish."
43,"Lebanon",30.685714285714287,"The Jeune Red from Château Musar's second line (formerly labeled Musar Cuvée Rouge) is a blend of Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that smells sweetly of ripe black cherries with rustic herbal and earthy notes. It opens softly with sweet blackberries and a hint of green bramble, but is chased by a mid-palate of fairly aggressive tannins and acidity. Fermented and aged in concrete vats, the Musar Jeune is completely unoaked and intended for early consumption, but would probably do nicely with some bottle aging as well."
44,"Bosnia and Herzegovina",12.5,"Toasted oak and cedar notes meld into lush, ripe black plums on the nose and palate of this fruit-forward, richly concentrated wine from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It's a straightforward, accessible wine, but well balanced with smooth tannins and a bright acidity"
